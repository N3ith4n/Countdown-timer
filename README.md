# Countdown-timer
A working discord countdown timer (you have to change the date in the code yourself tho)

If you want to try this on your own server first go and invite this bot to your server
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=796037044912390144&scope=bot

the bot has other functions but aside from the countdown timer they are broken (so ye I'm only gonna #share the command for the countdown)

do 
!!countdown
to run the timer

#update
Due to not being able to share this code publicly with the bot token in the code, if you want to use this in your own server just message me
